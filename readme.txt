v1.6
Hello my dear user, I am Ah. This is  main moments, which may raise questions about my bot:

Important! Corrected hole in security system!

list libraries:
datetime
pysqlite3-0.5.0
pyTelegramBotAPI-4.11.0
dotenv -1.0.0

First: defalt admin password = 0000(Then you can enter new admin password)
Second: Necessary files.
Necessary files: main.py, config.py, Ahsql.py, Keyboards.py(You can find this files in the github repository)
*Database can create itself.
*Updated admin panel: Now you can send message to group, read messages by the piece and delelte messages by the piece.
*Added 'ban - system'. You can block a user from the admin panel.

Now there are 2 ways. 
The first way - you can insert your data into the config. \
The second way - using an environment variable. 
You can create  .env file and paste your data.

Sample .env file:

TGAPI = "Your Telegram_api_token"
GID = "Your_group_ID_(integer)"
NDB = "your_path_to_database"


All, if will questions write me on email.
GoodBye.
